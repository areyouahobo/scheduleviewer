My first attempt at making a useful Chrome extension.
An extension that shows the current class, time remaining, and the next class.

## Installing ##
1) Download all files into a blank folder
2) In Chrome, click the 3-dot menu in the top right > More Tools > Extensions
3) Make sure the "Developer Mode" box is ticked
4) Click "Pack Extension" and select the directory where you downloaded the files
5) Drag and drop the generated .crx file onto the extensions page

Alternatively, you can click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the folder.
